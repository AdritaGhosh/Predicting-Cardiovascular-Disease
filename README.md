# Predicting Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally. This project leverages AI and machine learning to predict heart disease early, using patient data including medical history, lifestyle factors, and genetic information. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective prevention and management.

## Project Proposal
* **Problem Statement:** Traditional CVD diagnosis methods can be time-consuming and costly.
* **Aim and Objective:** Accurately predict the presence and severity of heart disease using various medical attributes.
* **Dataset:** (Processed Cleveland dataset)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, with 303 instances and 14 attributes.
